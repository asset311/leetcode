405. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal
https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-a-number-to-hexadecimal/

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement

Note:

 1. All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
 2. The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
 3. The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 4. You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
