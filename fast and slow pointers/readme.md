## Fast and slow pointers
* This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic linked lists or arrays.

### How do you identify when to use Fast and Slow pattern?
* The problem will deal with a loop in a linked list or array.
* When you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list.
* In a linked list where you cannot move in backwards direction, this should be used instead of Two Pointer pattern.
