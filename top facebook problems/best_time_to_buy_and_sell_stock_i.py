121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

Example 2:
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

# Greedy algorithm that computes potential profit at the current price
# Keep track of the minimum price seen so far, so as to maximise potential profit
# Time is O(n) where n is the length of the prices array
# Space is O(1) since we only keep a couple of additional variables
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    
    max_profit = 0
    if len(prices) == 0:
        return max_profit
    
    min_price = prices[0]
    
    for price in prices[1:]:
        max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
    
    return max_profit
