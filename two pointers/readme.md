Two Pointers is a pattern where two pointers iterate through the data structure in tandem until one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition.<br>
Two Pointers is often useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list; <br>
for example, when you have to compare each element of an array to its other elements. <br>
Ways to identify when to use the Two Pointer method:
* It will feature problems where you deal with _sorted_ arrays (or Linked Lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints
* The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray
